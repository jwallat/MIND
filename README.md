# Forked MIND
This is a forked version of the MIND repository. I adjusted the scraper to also include the news ids in its output. That should allow for more convenience in finding the corresponding news article texts for given news ids. 

Please follow the instructions in the crawler folder. 


# Original Readme
Microsoft News Dataset is a large-Scale English dataset for news recommendation research. This repository provides the script to evaluate models and a sample submission for MIND News Recommendation Challenge.
